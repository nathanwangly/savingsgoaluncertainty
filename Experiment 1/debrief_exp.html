<p>
What are the research questions?
</p>

<p>
We were interested in understanding how people’s decision-making processes (in this case, the choice between spending and saving behaviour) are influenced by uncertainty. In particular, we are interested in two types of uncertainty. The first is income uncertainty, which occurs when a person does not receive a stable income. The second is goal uncertainty, which occurs when a person is unsure of how much they need to save towards a longer-term goal.

How does this study extend previous research on this topic?
</p>

<p>
Previous research has examined the way in which people make choices under uncertainty – that is, situations in which the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities are not readily known. For example, we are expected to make decisions about how much to spend or save without being fully knowledgeable of the likelihood of needing money for a future emergency (or the amount that would require). Past experiments have typically explored the impact of uncertainty through discrete choices, where each decision is independent of the others. We sought to extend this research by instead examining the impact of uncertainty on repeated, inter-connected choices (as is the case in the real-world).

<p>
What are some potential real-world implications of this research?
</p>

<p>
We chose to study income uncertainty and goal uncertainty because of their potential relevance to the real world. In terms of income uncertainty, our research may help to understand whether people who are subject to volatile incomes (e.g., gig economy workers) may be prone to making poorer financial decisions. In terms of goal uncertainty, our research may help to understand whether uncertain goals are a driver in under-saving for the future (e.g., for emergencies or retirement).

<p>
Briefly describe a potential issue (e.g., ethical, practical) or limitation of the study (e.g., design, ecological validity).
</p>

<p>
One practical issue with our study is the challenge of simulating time delays. In real life, one of the reasons why saving (or being future-focused more generally) in our decision-making is that there is a delay in these future rewards. This often leads us to make choices that reward us in the present, but may hurt us in the long-run. In contrast, our experimental task only lasts 30 minutes, so the sacrifice required to delay gratification (by saving) is likely much smaller than in reality. This raises a potential concern about the ecological validity of our findings.

<p>
Briefly describe the study methodology (e.g., design, dependent/ independent variables, materials).
</p>

<p>
This study involved a financial decision-making task where participants made repeated choices between spending their hypothetical income (for smaller, immediate rewards) and saving towards a goal (for a larger, delayed reward). We used a between-subjects design, with the independent variable being the type and level of uncertainty experienced. Some participants would have experienced income uncertainty (income varied each round), while others experienced goal uncertainty (unclear amount required for the goal). Within these groups, we also varied the level of uncertainty; for example, participants with low income uncertainty had their income range between $450-550, whereas participants with high income uncertainty had their income range between $50-$950. Our dependent variable was the savings behaviour of participants across the task.
