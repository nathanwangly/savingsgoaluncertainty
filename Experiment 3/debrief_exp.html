What are the research questions?
</p>

<p>
We were interested in understanding how people’s decision-making processes (in this case, the choice between spending and saving behaviour) are influenced by goal uncertainty. In particular, we are interested in how people manage their spending and saving based on how likely they think they are to achieve uncertain goals - where a person does not know exactly how much they need to save.

How does this study extend previous research on this topic?
</p>

<p>
Previous research has examined the way in which people make choices under uncertainty – that is, situations in which the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities are not readily known. For example, we are expected to make decisions about how much to spend or save without being fully knowledgeable of the likelihood of needing money for a future emergency (or the amount that would require). Past experiments have typically explored the impact of uncertainty through discrete choices, where each decision is independent of the others. We sought to extend this research by instead examining the impact of uncertainty on repeated, inter-connected choices (as is the case in the real-world).

<p>
What are some potential real-world implications of this research?
</p>

<p>
We chose to study goal uncertainty because of its potential relevance to the real world. Our research may help to understand the extent to which uncertainty about how much needs to be saved is a driver in under-saving for the future (e.g., for emergencies or retirement).

Briefly describe a potential issue (e.g., ethical, practical) or limitation of the study (e.g., design, ecological validity).
</p>

<p>
One practical issue with our study is the challenge of simulating time delays. In real life, one of the reasons why saving (or being future-focused more generally) in our decision-making is that there is a delay in these future rewards. This often leads us to make choices that reward us in the present, but may hurt us in the long-run. In contrast, our experimental task only lasts 30 minutes, so the sacrifice required to delay gratification (by saving) is likely much smaller than in reality. This raises a potential concern about the ecological validity of our findings.

<p>
Briefly describe the study methodology (e.g., design, dependent/ independent variables, materials).
</p>

<p>
This study involved a financial decision-making task where participants made repeated choices between spending their hypothetical income (for smaller, immediate rewards) and saving towards a goal (for a larger, delayed reward). We used a between-subjects design, with the independent variable being the level of goal uncertainty experienced. The savings goal could have ranged between $3,500-$7,500, $4,500-$8,500, $5,500-$9,500, or $6,500-$10,500. However, the actual goal was $6,000 regardless of which condition participants were allocated to. Our dependent variable was the savings behaviour of participants across the task.
